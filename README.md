# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_AIRBNB_DATA

This project focuses on an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings data from New York City to uncover key patterns and insights related to pricing, availability, host performance, and guest engagement. With a dataset of nearly 49,000 entries, it aims to explore how factors such as location, room type, host activity, and customer reviews influence the overall dynamics of the short-term rental market. Through systematic data preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling, the project seeks to identify meaningful relationships and trends that can help optimize listing strategies and enhance market understanding. By examining various aspects - from host behavior and property distribution to booking patterns - this analysis offers a comprehensive view of how Airbnb operates across different neighborhoods in NYC. The project not only contributes to understanding market behavior but also provides valuable insights that can guide better decision-making for hosts, analysts, and researchers. It was successfully completed under the guidance of UNP (United Network of Professionals).
